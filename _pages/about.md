Hi, my name is Zhou Wentao (周文涛). I am currently a Senior Staff Engineer at Huawei Singapore Research Center, specializing in short-range communications. I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Korea University. My research interests include physical layer wireless communications, statistical signal processing, and large language models.
